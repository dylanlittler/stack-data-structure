# A stack implementation in C

This project implements basic stack functions, push and pull,
using a struct data structure to add and remove ints.
The file dbg.h is included, a header file written by Zed Shaw using
the MIT licence. This file defines macros for checking inputs
and printing debugging information.
The file minunit.h, in tests directory, is also a header file written by Zed Shaw
using MIT licence. This file defines macros for a unit test system.
The structure of the makefile was also provided by Zed Shaw.
The code for his library can be found at https://github.com/zedshaw/liblcthw
